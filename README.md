### Long Description

* Parasite Frontline is a modpack about you thriving a world with your Tactical-Doll gals, against the Parasites that are infecting the Overworld.

  * Your fragile body is quite weak compared to those synthetic robots, needing constant supply of food, water and air. However, your nimbleness allow you to dodge incomiung attacks by quickly moving into 1 direction, using the ALT key.
  * Hunger no longer drains from re-generating hearts, and instead decays at a constant slow rate. To compensate for this, most foods heal less hunger points(about a quarter), and stacks are limited. Thirst, acts as a secondary hunger bar.
  * While you can drink from groundwater, you will be better off using purified water to quench your thirst for a long time. This can be achieved in numerous ways. There is also heat mechanic, needing to keeping warm/cold is pretty important.
  * Every full moon(this includes the first night), a Bloody Moon rises- making every last block filled with mobs. To endure, eating correct types of foods and keeping the nutrition at a certain level gives you bonus effects. eating many types of foods also yields you more HP(not including the after-life).
  * When dead, your body will leave a corpse, in order to store your items. Same goes for the Sophisticated Backpacks, and saves your inventory when Mortis. While you do need to worry about getting back to the corpse, the Item will not be lost.
* To help you on this long, treacherous, and arguably not-that-much-hopefully journey, a simple Questline(with FTBQuests) is provided. However, there is no rewards(except for the late game challenge quests) for these questline, they are just there to guide through the multiple mods present in the modpack.
* Pack's main focus is on the HMGGirlsFront mod and the S&R Parasites mod, making the bulk of the overworld content. Other overworld mods included is the Immersive Engineering and it's addons, and Pollutions of the Realms mod.

  * Girl's Frontline mod allows you to get T-Dolls, and the guns of the T-Dolls using a gacha system. The crafting cost was greatly been meddled with, in order to be more in line with Immersive Engineering's production power. They need food, and ammo to function, so use them wisely.
  * Scape n Run Parasites mod is the Overworld's main threat, infecting your surroundings, entities, and getting the jump on you. Thankfully, however, your T-Dolls, made of what is essentially android parts with synthetic skin, and all that, is immune to the infection of the parasite.
  * Your main tool of resource gathering within the Overworld will be Immersive Engineering, and it's addon mods like Immersive Intelligence, Immersive Technology and so on. While Immersive Intelligence is pretty unstable, so I don't recommend trying to go too deep in that mod.
  * To prevent just building a decent factory and calling it a day without any consequences, there is now carbon, sulfur and dust that gets generated from these actions, as well as killing mobs. These pollution, in high doses, inflicts a debuff to the player only, making you weak.
  * Using various filters, or using enviornmental-friendly way to make energy will lessen the effects of the cloud. Nether is pretty much abandoned, and thus is highly toxic fumes dont make anyone survive in there for long, unless special actions were taken. The timer will be displayed on the screen.
* Exclusive to the nether, mostly, are the Thermal Machinery- needing those toxic and high heat enviornments to run, these machinery can do what Immersive Engineering machinery can't. Certain items can be used outside of this as well, making them quite useful.
* Betweenlands is in the pack, mostly as an "another option" to escape from the ruthless parasites. Much like the nether, parasites cannot infect this dimension. However, the difference in resources and the malfunction of your existing gear means that you have to employ a different stratagey.

  * Embers also exist as to fill the gaps in the now malfunctioning Immersive Engineering machinery can't do in the swamplands.
